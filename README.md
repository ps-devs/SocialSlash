## üöÄ Using and deploying the project

- You can deploy the project on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) by clicking the button below. It will clone the project in your GitHub account and you can deploy it on Vercel (While deploying, Vercel with ask name for the cloned project).

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FPradumnasaraf%2FSocialSlash)

- The cloned project will have the default links (of Pradumna Saraf). To change the links, update the `config/links.json` file with your links in your cloned repository. You can add as many links as you want with custom names. The structure of the file is as follows:

```json
{
  "github": "https://github.com/Pradumnasaraf",
  "linkedin": "https://www.linkedin.com/in/pradumnasaraf",
  "facebook": "https://www.facebook.com/pradumnasaraf.dev",
  "hashnode": "https://blog.pradumnasaraf.dev",
  "twitter": "https://twitter.com/pradumna_saraf",
  "instagram": "https://www.instagram.com/pradumnasaraf"
}
```

- Now you can access your links by hitting the endpoint. For example, if you want to access your GitHub profile, you can hit `https://your-deployed-url-on-vercel/github` and you will be redirected to your GitHub profile.

(You can also fork the project and deploy by yourself on Vercel)
